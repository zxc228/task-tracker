# Task Tracker

A minimal, fast, and secure task tracking app built as a pet project by [Ilya Istomin](https://github.com/zxc228).  
This project is designed as a full-stack portfolio piece with **FastAPI** on the backend and **Next.js** on the frontend (in progress).

---

## Project Structure
```bash
task-tracker/
├── backend/   → FastAPI app (API, auth, SQLite, JWT)
├── frontend/  → Next.js app (UI, not finished yet)
├── README.md  → you’re here
```

Each part of the project is fully independent and documented separately.
